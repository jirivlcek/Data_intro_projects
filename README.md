# Data_intro_projects
couple projects for building my python data science skills 

1. first project - simple predictor of gender using height, weight and shoe size. 
                   also comparing 4 different models
                   (code works!)
  problems:models work too well
           choosing models was random (need to build up more knowledge here)
